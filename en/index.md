# Who Am I?  

Hello, I'm MetroMan. I started with this identity in 2020 when I participated in BTE Chile as "FGY Games," working on recreating the Metro. The name MetroMan came from a teammate on that server (who is no longer active).  

After leaving BTE Chile in November 2024, I focused on three main projects during 2025:  

1. **Metro de Santiago Community**: In March, I resumed administration, in April I created the Subreddit and revived the MetroBot, and at the end of May, I integrated a WhatsApp group that had existed since 2024. In early June, I added a Telegram channel.  

2. **Balkeon**: My personal constructed language, which I've been developing again, picking up where I left off in 2022.  

3. **Bloksel**: A new project I started on April 30th, which is still in development.  

This revamped website is part of these projects. If you'd like to participate or learn more, join by clicking the images above.
